# WeatherWebApplication
Web Application to display 7 days weather The application is developed with simple, clean and robust code. There are lot of improvements can be done from look and feel to technologies.This application can be extended to any high level of project in future if needed.

I have called Weather API from javascript in this project, but it can also be done from Controlles in MVC ASP.net core as well.

Please run the application VS in admin mode as there is log file to be appended in CDrive.
Logs.txt will be created in c drive to log request and response details displayed on screen.
